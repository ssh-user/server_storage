### [ work in progress ] 

Cross-platform app build with electron and react on view to store and share files with remote server. Download\upload files using sftp by key or password.

Application has two sides “Public” and “Private”. “Public” files easy share with your friend by some web-server like nginx. “Private” is only for you.

**NOT IMPLEMENT FEATURE:**
- drag’n’drop files TO and FROM app.
- config page.
- slide bottom panel
- fix some bugs and test on different platforms.

**NOTE**

comments like “DEBUG” and then cyrillic symbols, it’s only for me, it’s some notes not to forget to implement or fix something.

Full manual for  “how to use” with screenshots will be after the end of development.


#### have a nice day!
